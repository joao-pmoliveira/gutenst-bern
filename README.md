# Project Gutenstöbern

Gutenstöbern is a modern, full-stack web platform for exploring and managing ebooks from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
Think 'Goodreads' but focused on public domain books.

## Project Goals

- Bring Project Gutenberg's into a modern UI;
- Allow users to browse, search and download ebooks easily;
- Provide users with a way to save favourites, track their progress on current books, and manage their TBR (to-be-read) pile;
- Allow users to create their own book lists;
- Eventually include ratings, reviews, etc;

# Tech

- **Next.js** - frontend (rendering, user session management, ui interactivity)
- **Spring Boot** - REST API backend (data models, CRUD operations)
- **Python** - script that parses Project Gutenberg's provided RDF catalog into a JSON structure more closely aligned with the app's data model

> Build steps soon
